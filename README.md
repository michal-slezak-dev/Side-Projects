# Side-Projects
Welcome to my side projects repository ðŸ™‚! Here you'll find a collection of practice projects that I've built to practise my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects range from simple web pages to more complex applications(int the future as I'm still learning), which allow me to try out various techniques and technologies.
